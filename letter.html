        <p><strong>Hey Dinrei,</strong></p>

        <p>
          So how was it?😋 I know tht it was pretty small but this was my first time doing this so cut me some slack on tht😅😅😅 but the next time, it will much greater than this and I hope tht by tht time I would be in college too, coz then I would have a little more free time to talk to you😍😍😍, and prepare more stuffs like this and I might just visit u sometimes😉😉😏😏 but tht thought is for some other time, I just hope tht u like it, If u were here or if I was there then we would have went out for dates and I would have kept on hugging u, never leaving you side, I promise to stay......not just when its easy but also when life gets hard and treats you unfairly, I will be there to listen to u, to console u, to love u when u need it the most coz I wanna grow with you slowly and gently......till we get married and have our own kids😊😊, because loving u isnt a day one promise.....its an everyday choice and I will always choose u, and I mean ALWAYS, till death do us apart❤️, I hope u were able to understand what I feel today, I want to make u the most happy woman and I hope to do tht when we are together. Thanks for loving me back Milady👑, From the bottommost part of my heart.....I LOVE YOU, DINREILIU GANGMEI❤️❤️❤️❤️🌹
