       you know, I heard somewhere tht at the touch of love, anybody can become a poet so, here is something for u.......Roses are red, violets are blue today is valentines day but I am not there for u.....but still I am here in my bed, thinking about you, about what we could do.....If I were there, I would never leave your side.....engulfing u in my arms, just to feel your warmth.... so tht when we part ways again, we could feel our presence in each other again...... I Love You......
