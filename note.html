    <p>
    Ammalu, first of all I wanna tell you tht I love u, from the bottom of my heart and I mean it and if u had felt tht I didnt, then I am truly sorry, I have made u angry alot of times tht I lost count🥲🥲 but tht just shows your love and care for me, This is the first time I have ever done something like this, making a website and making all the edits, so you are my first and hopefully my last person I ever do this to, remember when we had our first fight (atleast for me), I was really heartbroken tht day when u said tht but when u came back and to console me, I became the happiest man tht same day🥰🥰, u dont know how much I was blushing when u tried to console me, I get to hear your cute worried voice tht day which sooooo damn gud, thinking about it now, its making feel butterflies again 😆😆😆, u know i wanna tell u again in case u forgot I love you beautiful dark brown eyes, I love you cute voice, I love your cute and happy smile and the best trait tht I liked about u was your personality which attracted me the most. You are the most beautiful and the cutest lady tht I have seen and it will also be the last too, u are the best singer tht I have heard IRL too so u are just perfect to me, dont ever say tht u are not, do not let it even cross your mind tht there is someone better than you, if you put your mind to something, u can achieve it, I know it as it shows in your actions, so believe me when I say, YOU ARE JUST ✨PERFECT✨
